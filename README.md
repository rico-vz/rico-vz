## About Me

Hey there! I'm Rico van Zelst, a 22-year-old Full Stack Developer who's passionate about creating websites and software. I love making things and solving problems.

I often use PHP, Laravel and JavaScript to build websites and web applications. I also have experience with Vue.js and Tailwind CSS. I'm always looking to learn new things and improve my skills. 
I'm currently learning Go for small scripts and backend services, which has been a lot of fun. 

For as long as I can remember, I have been obsessed with all things tech, and I am looking forward to getting deep into software development for both the problem-solving and creative design aspects. Willing to assist organizations in building the best technical solutions in today's competitive market.

### Glad to see you here!  

I'm Rico, a 20-year-old full-stack developer student at the Bit Academy.

Whilst being a software engineering student, I am also involved in a number of projects, which involve freelance web development.

I love seeking different ways to refine existing skills and further my knowledge.

For as long as I can remember, I have been obsessed with all things tech, and I am looking forward to getting deep into software development for both the 
problem-solving  and creative design aspects. Willing to assist organizations in building the best technical solutions in today's competitive market.
